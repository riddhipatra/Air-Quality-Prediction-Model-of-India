# Air-Quality-Prediction-Model-of-India
Air Quality Index (AQI) is a crucial parameter to assess the quality of the air we breathe. India, being one of the most populous countries, faces significant challenges related to air pollution. To address this issue, a project has been undertaken to develop an AQI predicting model for various cities in India.The model utilizes Python and machine learning techniques to forecast AQI levels based on historical data and relevant environmental features.
Objectives:
The primary objectives of the AQI predicting model project are as follows:

    Develop an accurate and reliable AQI prediction model to forecast air quality in different cities across India.
    Utilize machine learning algorithms to identify key environmental parameters that significantly impact AQI levels.
    Provide a user-friendly interface for stakeholders to access real-time AQI predictions and historical data.
    Raise awareness about air quality and encourage actions to reduce pollution levels.
The AQI predicting model will follow these key steps:

    Data Collection: Historical AQI data, meteorological data (temperature, humidity, wind speed, etc.), and pollutant concentrations (PM2.5, PM10, NO2, SO2, CO, O3) from 
    various monitoring stations across different cities in India will be collected. Additionally, external factors like industrial activities, traffic density, and geographical 
    features may be considered if available.

    Data Preprocessing: The collected data will undergo preprocessing, including handling missing values, outlier detection, and data normalization. Feature engineering 
    techniques may be applied to create additional relevant features.

    Feature Selection: To improve the model's performance and reduce computation time, feature selection techniques (e.g., correlation analysis, feature importance) will be 
    employed to identify the most influential features.

    Model Selection: Several machine learning algorithms will be explored, such as Linear Regression, Decision Trees, Random Forest, Support Vector Machines (SVM), Gradient 
    Boosting, and Neural Networks. Cross-validation techniques will be employed to evaluate and compare the models' performance.

    Model Training: The selected machine learning model will be trained on the preprocessed dataset. Hyperparameter tuning will be performed to optimize model performance.

    Model Evaluation: The trained model will be evaluated using appropriate performance metrics like Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Mean Squared Error (MSE), and R-squared (R2) on a 
    test dataset. Model performance will be visualized through graphs and plots.

    Real-time Prediction: The model will be integrated into a user-friendly web application that allows users to input relevant environmental parameters and receive real-time 
    AQI predictions for their selected location.

Tools and Libraries:
The project will be implemented using the Python programming language, and the following libraries will be utilized:

    Pandas and NumPy for data manipulation and preprocessing.
    Scikit-learn for machine learning algorithms and model evaluation.
    Matplotlib and Seaborn for data visualization.
    Flask for web application development.
